# Description:
This repository showcases a Fashion Image Generator built using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in TensorFlow. The model is capable of generating synthetic fashion images, offering a versatile tool for creative design, data augmentation, and more. It's trained on the popular Fashion MNIST dataset, making it accessible and adaptable for various image generation tasks.

# How to Run the Fashion Image Generator:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-image-generator.git

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd fashion-image-generator
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python dependencies installed. You can typically install them using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 3: Dataset Preparation

1. The Fashion MNIST dataset is included in TensorFlow, so you don't need to download it separately. The script or notebook provided in the repository will load the dataset automatically.

## Step 4: Training the GAN Model

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script designed for training the GAN model.
2. Execute the script to train the GAN on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
3. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator that work in opposition to each other. The generator learns to create realistic fashion images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated images.
4. The training process involves iteratively updating both the generator and discriminator until the generator generates convincing fashion images.

## Step 5: Generating Fashion Images

1. After training, you can use the trained generator model to create synthetic fashion images.
2. Modify and run the provided code for generating fashion images with the generator.

# Working of the Fashion Image Generator:

1. The Fashion Image Generator employs a GAN architecture, consisting of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator.
2. The generator aims to create realistic fashion images from random noise. It starts with random noise as input and progressively refines it into an image that resembles real fashion items.
3. The discriminator, on the other hand, learns to distinguish between real fashion images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator.
4. During training, the generator and discriminator compete against each other. The generator strives to generate images that are indistinguishable from real ones, while the discriminator tries to become better at identifying fakes.
5. This adversarial training process results in a generator that can produce high-quality synthetic fashion images.

NOTE : This model is only trained with 20 epochs in the code. But the h5 file provided is trained on 1000 epochs. That's why the h5 file will give much much better results.
The generated images can be used for various purposes, such as data augmentation, artistic design, or even as a starting point for further image manipulation tasks.
